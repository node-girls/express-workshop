# Express Workshop

## What is this?

This is an introductory workshop to Node.js and Express. You'll be building your own platform to write, publish and save blog posts (a basic content management system, or CMS).

## Why?

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is one of the most widely-used frameworks for Node.js. It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to build your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation for becoming a Node.js developer :sparkles:

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into a number of steps. At the end of each segment, you should find a link to continue onto the next step. We suggest you follow along with the tutorial online, and write your code in a separate repository.

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough. Try to resist the urge to copy and paste - you will learn much more if you get into the habit of typing things out. 

Throughout each step, we have **bolded** any jargon that you may or may not be familiar with. These terms are explained in the [Keywords](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/#keywords) section at the bottom of each page. You'll also find a link to our cheatsheets under [Useful Links](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/#useful-links).

## Before you Start

#### 1. Set up your development environment

We encourage you to use [cloud9.io](https://c9.io) to complete this workshop as it's very easy to set up a Nodejs workspace and start coding straightaway. 

:raising_hand: **If you don't have a cloud9.io account, please let any of the mentors know and we'll send you an invitation to join our group space.**

If you're comfortable setting up your development enviroment locally, please download Node from the Node.js website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### 2. Fork this repository
Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  Instructions for doing this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

#### 3. Create a workspace in Cloud9.io
If you're using [cloud9.io](https://c9.io) create a new workspace. Instructions for doing this can be found [here](https://docs.c9.io/v1.0/docs/create-a-workspace).

:raising_hand: Make sure you:

- Enter the URL to your github forked repo `$ https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-workshop`
- Select Node.js as your workspace template

#### 4. Clone the repository in your local environment
If you're working in your local environment, clone your forked version of the repository to your desktop in the terminal. Instructions for doing this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), or run the command below.

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-workshop`

This creates an express-workshop directory with the repository content inside. Change into the express-workshop directory, since that's where we'll be working from now on.

`$ cd express-workshop`
