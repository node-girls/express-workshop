### Asynchronous Testing

  Now let's restart the server `npm run start` and run those tests again, `npm run test`

  Oh dear, another problem

Any guesses on what might be happening?

### What is the issue??
The final line "asynchronous operations weren't stopped" might give us a clue.

Remember how Node is asynchronous and we used callbacks to deal with this in the Express workshop? 

Well the same goes for our tests, they also need to handle requests asynchronously. In our tests, we need to wait for the requests to be done before we can check the response.

Luckily it's pretty easy with Jest, we need to use the `async`, `await` and `done` keywords.

Let's re-write our test to include these keywords

___

```
it('should return 200 status on the GET endpoint', async done => {
    const response = await request.get('/get-posts')

    expect(response.status).toBe(200)

    done()
})
```

Let's break this down:
 - The `async` function is always coupled with an `await` expression.
 - The `async` function will wait until the `await` expression has completed, in our case the get request. Once that has completed the function will continue. 
 - The `done` keyword lets Jest know that your tests are finished.

Ok, we should be set to run the test again
```
npm run test
```

A passing test!! We did it!
