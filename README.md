# Express Workshop

### What is this?

This is an introductory workshop to Node.js and Express. You'll be building your own platform to write, publish and save blog posts (a basic content management system, or CMS).

### Why?

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is one of the most widely-used frameworks for Node.js. It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to build your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation for becoming a Node.js developer :sparkles:
